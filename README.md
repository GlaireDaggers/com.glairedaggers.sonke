# SonKE
Repository for the Sonic Kinematic Engine for Unity 2020.3 and above

# Goals
To implement a toolkit for Sonic Adventure-inspired physics with a focus on making sure things are efficient, self-contained, and well structured. It is NOT designed
to implement most or even very much of a full game's mechanics - it is designed to solve what is in my opinion the hardest problem, which is implementing good solid
Sonic-style physics. That said, many example mechanics are included and can serve as guides for building your own.

# Installation
To install SonKE in a new Unity project, just open the Package Manager -> Add Package From Git URL and enter this repository's URL (git://github.com/GlaireDaggers/com.glairedaggers.sonke.git)
